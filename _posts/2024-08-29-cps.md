This is an introductory post on CPS (Continuation Passing Style), also acting as
my personal review on the subject. I aim to provide an overview of CPS itself, its
actual applications and behaviours from a more programming perspective, and link CPS
to the `Cont` monad and `CallCC` control operators.
