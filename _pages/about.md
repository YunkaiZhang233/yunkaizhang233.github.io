This webpage is still under construction at the moment and please forgive me for the missing stuff :D

## About Me

I am currently a 2nd year undergraduate student studying Computing (_equiv_ Computer Science) at Imperial College London, expected to graduate in 2026.

My current interest mainly lies within **Programming Languages, Formal Verification** and their relevant applications in Language Design, Computer Systems and Software Engineering.

Outside of working stuff I love to do a bit of philosophical and psychological discussions, VR gaming, lightweight trailing, enjoying theatrical arts (particularly musicals), as well asresearching and discovering public transport and rail systems (in particular Transport of London). I'm proudly a member of Imperial RailSoc.


## Some Little Thoughts

I wrote some miscallenous articles and idea drafts on both technical and non-technical topics. They will be migrated into this website in the future.
