This webpage is still under construction at the moment and please forgive me for the missing stuff :)

## About Me

I am currently a 2nd year undergraduate student studying Computing (_equiv_ Computer Science) at Imperial College London, expected to graduate in 2026.

My current interest mainly lies within **Programming Languages, Formal Verification**.


## Some Little Thoughts

I wrote some miscallenous articles and idea drafts on both technical and non-technical topics. They will be migrated into this website in the future.
